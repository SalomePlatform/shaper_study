The build procedure of the SALOME platform is implemented with CMake.
In order to build the module you have to do the following actions:

1. Set up environment for pre-requisites (see "Pre-requisites" section above).

2. Create a build directory:

   % mkdir SHAPERSTUDY_BUILD

3. Configure the build procedure:

   % cd SHAPERSTUDY_BUILD
   % cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<mode> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_directory> <path_to_src_dir>

   where
   - <mode> is either Release or Debug (default: Release);
   - <installation_directory> is a destination folder to install SALOME SHAPERSTUDY
     module (default: /usr);
