# Module adding some methods to CORBA API of GEM_Gen, analogously to geomBuilder.py.
#   WARNING: do not try to use it in the same way as geomBuilder because
# it provides limited functionality, it implements only methods used by smeshBuilder
#
# Typical use is:
#     import shaperBuilder
#     shaper = shaperBuilder.New()
#     from salome.smesh import smeshBuilder
#     smesh = smeshBuilder.New( instanceGeom = shaper )
